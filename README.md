## Introduction
Resipe is a recipe sharing webapp where user's karma and location affect their permissions to perform operations such as view recipe or upvote recipe, it fetches the data dynamically from a mysql server and uses auth0 for authentication, opal for authorisation implementing custom opal data fetcher for mysql.

Two main goals of this project were:
- to build a custom opal data fetcher for mysql
- to use this custom data fetcher with mysql for real world applications

## Features
- Create new recipes and share them with everyone
- View recipes based on your location
- Upvote recipes to show your appreciation
- Gain karma points when you upvote or create new recipes

## TechStack
- Reactjs for frontend
- MUI for styling and frontend components
- Zustand for global state management in frontend
- Auth0 for authentication (authN)
- Opal for authorisation (authZ)
- Nodejs (Express) for backend
- MySQL for database
- Prisma for ORM
- axios to fetch data

## Installation
To install and run this project, we have three services to start, follow these steps to run the project locally

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhimeshagrawal/Resipe.git
    cd Resipe
    ```
   
2. **Start the OPAL Service**
   The opal service uses `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` to start and initialize instances of
   - mysql server ( host: "example_db", user: "root", password: "mysql", db: "test", port: 3306 )
   - adminer ( port: 8083 , to explore database )
   - opal server ( port: 7002, which uses MySQLFetchProvider to fetch data which is written in src directory and uses github repo to fetch policies )
   - opal client ( port: 8181 )

   Before running this service, make sure you upload the policy.rego file in a separate github repo and add its url in `docker-compose.yml`
   To run these services, execute the following command in root directory of the project containing `docker-compose.yml`
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
   
3. **Start the server**
   Before starting server make sure that OPAL service is up and then create a `.env` file in `server` directory and paste following code into it.
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:mysql@localhost:3306/test
   ```
   This url is based on configs mentioned in `docker-compose.yml`, you can change it accordingly.

   Now execute the following commands in your `server` directory to start the server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run prisma:migrate
   npm run dev
   ```
   Now our server will start at `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Creating Auth0 Credentials**
   - Go to Auth0 and create credentials for your single page app (react)
   - Disable email+password login and only enable google oauth login
   - Replace the `domain` and `clientId` from auth0 in `App.jsx` file present in client
   
7. **Start the client**
   Before starting client make sure that server is up and then run following commands in `client` directory to start the client:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Now our client will start at `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

You can run the client at `http://localhost:5173`
- Initially every logged in user will have **Foodie** role with 0 karma and "India" as default country.
- Every Foodie user can view recipe of same country of his current location, you can change you current location from navbar.
- A Foodie user cannot upvote to any of recipes
- After adding a recipe in app, user will be given **Chef** role with increase in karma by 50.
- A chef can view recipe of all the countries
- A chef can upvote any recipe, also upvoting a recipe increases karma by 10

You can explore your mysql database through adminer using `http://localhost:8083`

You can check OPA cache data by making a GET request to url `http://localhost:8181/v1/data`

You can check your current policies by making a GET request to url `http://localhost:7002/policy`

You can publish a data update event by making a POST request to url `http://localhost:7002/data/config` with sending entries object as body
